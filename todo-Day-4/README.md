# Day 4 - Pipes, Routing, Lazy Loading, and To-Do App

## Overview
Today, we learned about:
- Angular Pipes (both built-in and custom).
- Advanced Routing and Guards.
- Lazy Loading modules in Angular for performance optimization.

### Conceptual Questions:
1. **What are Angular pipes, and how do they work?**
2. **Explain lazy loading in Angular and its importance.**
3. **What is an Angular route guard, and when should you use one?**
4. **How do you create a custom pipe in Angular?**
5. **What is eager loading, and how does it differ from lazy loading?**

### Assignment
We built a **To-Do App** that uses lazy loading for optimizing performance and route guards for protecting certain routes.
