# Day 1 - Introduction to Web Basics

## Overview
On the first day, we learned the fundamentals of:
- **HTML**: Structure of a webpage
- **CSS**: Styling the webpage
- **JavaScript**: Basic functionality and interactions

### Conceptual Questions:
1. **What is the difference between block-level and inline-level elements?**
2. **How does the CSS box model work?**
3. **What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?**
4. **Explain event bubbling in JavaScript.**
5. **What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**

### Project Description
For our practical assignment, we created a Gmail-like layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features a header with a logo, a sidebar for navigation, a search box to filter emails, and a scrollable email list, allowing us to apply the concepts we learned about web structure and design.
